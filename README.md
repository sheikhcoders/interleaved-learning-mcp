## 📚 Documentation

### What is Interleaved Learning?

Interleaved learning is a cognitive strategy backed by decades of research that involves mixing different topics during study sessions instead of focusing on one topic at a time (blocked practice).

#### Research-Backed Benefits

| Benefit | Improvement |
|---------|-------------|
| Long-term retention | Up to 43% better |
| Concept discrimination | Significantly improved |
| Knowledge transfer | Enhanced application |
| Problem-solving | More flexible approaches |

> "Interleaving is one of the most powerful learning strategies available, yet remains underutilized." — Rohrer & Taylor, 2007

## 🛠️ Available Tools

### 1. `create_study_plan`
Generate interleaved study schedules with 5 research-backed patterns.

```json
{
  "subjects": ["Mathematics", "Physics", "Chemistry"],
  "totalMinutes": 90,
  "pattern": "ABCABC"
}
```

**Patterns Available:**
- `ABAB` - Simple alternation (beginner)
- `ABCABC` - Triple rotation (intermediate)
- `ABACBC` - Spaced mixing (intermediate)
- `Random` - Maximum interleaving (advanced)
- `Blocked-to-Interleaved` - Gradual transition (beginner)

### 2. `generate_interleaved_quiz`
Create mixed-topic quizzes that strengthen discrimination learning.

### 3. `create_flashcard_deck`
Build multi-topic flashcard decks for interleaved review.

### 4. `get_shuffled_flashcards`
Retrieve flashcards in shuffled order across topics.

### 5. `log_study_session`
Track study sessions with duration and quiz scores.

### 6. `get_learning_progress`
View statistics and personalized recommendations.

### 7. `get_interleaving_patterns`
Learn about different interleaving strategies and their use cases.
