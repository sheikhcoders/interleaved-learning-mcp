# Interleaved Learning MCP Server

> A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server implementing cognitive science-backed interleaved learning techniques for optimal knowledge retention.

## MCP Endpoint

https://interleaved-learning-mcp.vercel.app/api/mcp

## Overview

This MCP server provides 7 tools for implementing interleaved learning - a research-backed cognitive strategy that improves long-term retention by up to 43% compared to blocked practice.

## Available Tools

- create_study_plan: Generate interleaved study schedules with 5 patterns (ABAB, ABCABC, ABACBC, Random, Blocked-to-Interleaved)
- generate_interleaved_quiz: Create mixed-topic quizzes for discrimination learning
- create_flashcard_deck: Build multi-topic flashcard decks
- get_shuffled_flashcards: Retrieve interleaved flashcards for study
- log_study_session: Track study sessions with duration and scores
- get_learning_progress: View statistics and personalized recommendations
- get_interleaving_patterns: Learn about interleaving strategies

## Connection

Transport: Streamable HTTP
Protocol: Model Context Protocol (MCP)
