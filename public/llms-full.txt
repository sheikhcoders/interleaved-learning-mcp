# Interleaved Learning MCP Server - Complete Documentation

> A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server implementing cognitive science-backed interleaved learning techniques for optimal knowledge retention.

## MCP Endpoint

https://interleaved-learning-mcp.vercel.app/api/mcp

## What is This?

This is a remote MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that provides AI assistants with tools for implementing interleaved learning - a research-backed cognitive strategy proven to improve long-term retention by up to 43% compared to traditional blocked practice.

## What is Interleaved Learning?

Interleaved learning involves mixing different topics during study sessions instead of focusing on one topic at a time. Research shows this approach:

- Improves long-term retention (up to 43% better - Rohrer & Taylor, 2007)
- Enhances ability to distinguish between similar concepts
- Improves transfer of knowledge to new situations
- Builds more flexible problem-solving skills

The key insight: The "desirable difficulty" of switching between topics forces the brain to practice retrieval and discrimination, strengthening neural pathways.

## Available Tools (7 Total)

### 1. create_study_plan

Generate an interleaved study schedule for multiple subjects.

**Parameters:**
- subjects (array, required): List of subjects to study (2-6 items)
- totalMinutes (number, required): Total study time (20-240 minutes)
- pattern (string, optional): Interleaving pattern to use

**Available Patterns:**
- ABAB: Simple alternation between two subjects (beginner)
- ABCABC: Triple rotation through three subjects (intermediate)
- ABACBC: Spaced mixing for better retention (intermediate)
- Random: Random shuffle for maximum interleaving (advanced)
- Blocked-to-Interleaved: Start blocked, gradually increase mixing (beginner)

**Example:**
```json
{
  "subjects": ["Mathematics", "Physics", "Chemistry"],
  "totalMinutes": 90,
  "pattern": "ABCABC"
}
```

**Returns:** Structured study plan with time blocks, activities, and tips.

          "options": ["x = 5", "x = 10", "x = 7.5", "x = 3"],
          "correctIndex": 0
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "questionsPerTopic": 3

## Research Background

Interleaved learning is supported by extensive cognitive science research:

1. **Rohrer & Taylor (2007)**: Found 43% improvement in test performance with interleaving vs. blocking
2. **Kornell & Bjork (2008)**: Demonstrated benefits for learning artist painting styles
3. **Taylor & Rohrer (2010)**: Showed interleaving helps students learn to solve different types of math problems

Key mechanisms:
- **Discrimination learning**: Forces learners to identify which strategy applies
- **Retrieval practice**: Switching topics requires recalling previous material
- **Desirable difficulty**: Challenge during learning strengthens memory traces

## Technical Details

- **Protocol**: Model Context Protocol (MCP)
- **Transport**: Streamable HTTP
- **Framework**: Next.js 15
- **Adapter**: mcp-handler (Vercel)
- **Validation**: Zod schemas
- **Deployment**: Vercel Edge Functions
